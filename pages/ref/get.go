						Programming is my passion. I've been coding from a very young age and still do so. I have created and contributed to many open source projects. My
						main interest lies in frontend, backend, and devops. I build frameworks and automate common tasks to make it easier to develop applications. I do
						occasionally work on creating 2d games.
